# Interpreter for C like language written in TypeScript

Just as the name suggests, this is an interpreter built from scratch for a C like language called 'Monkey'. It is based on the book 'Building an Interpreter in Go'. My goal is to use this as an intermediary stage to ultimately build a compiler but most importantly have fun whilst developing very strong fundamentals in computer science. The book provides code snippets in Go to build the interpreter, but I have chosen to convert it to TypeScript to develop my skills even further and make it usable in production codebases that use Ts.
